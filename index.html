                                UnRaid is a very usefull platform that can be used to set up a file storage system, run Docker containers, and host virtual machines (VMs) efficiently. This has allowed me to do things like run a Minecraft server, multiple webservers, and create my own local backup storage system that I use to store all my work. Using a forward proxy, we can also add some additional security to the UI for safe exposure to the internet.

                                <p>
                                    HTML was the easiest to learn, in my opinion, but from my experience, you can't do much with it alone—so where's the fun? Obviously used to structure a webpage, you'll usually get the gist of HTML after 1-2 projects. HTML gets more interesting once you introduce it to PHP, JavaScript, and CSS, but it still provides the foundation for a webpage, so it's certainly necessary to be familiar enough with it to read and comprehend.
                                </p>
                        </div>

                <!-- PHP Project Slide -->

                            <h4>PHP</h4>
                                <p>
                                    PHP was introduced as a helpful tool for connecting your site to a database. From using PHP to create data tables to using it as a way to enable login functionality, it certainly pulls its weight in some of my projects. Its only downside is having to write SQL to query the database, because who isn’t slightly intimidated by SQL, especially with a full database?
                                </p>
                        </div>

                <!-- JavaScript Project Slide -->

                            <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                                <p>
                                    JavaScript is your best friend when you want to add a little bit more functionality. Whether that be by using it to send input data to your database through PHP, or just using it to make things on your webpage more dynamic and fun. For example, the spinning hamburger menu that's available on this site's mobile version. Try it out!
                                </p>
                        </div>

                <!-- CSS Project Slide -->

                                <p>
                                    Although CSS has its perks when it comes to creating a better look and flow for your website, it’s not necessarily my cup of tea. However, we've all seen super nice-looking websites that really showcase its capabilities. In an attempt to better develop my skills in CSS, I created this portfolio webpage to play around with it a bit more. So, what do you think?

                                <p>
                                    Admittedly, I am a bit biased towards YAML, as it was my introduction to bossing the computer around, but it is one of the easiest to read, which is my favorite part. Although Home Assistant has become more and more accessible through its UI over the years, you can still really utilize YAML for things like better styling your dashboard for ease of use or just to make it look pretty.

                                    During my first year at Ole Miss, I worked at the IT Helpdesk for the University. This is where students and faculty would go for their tech support. Not something I would want to do for the rest of my life, but it did help me improve my technical skills. Although 60% of the calls were about simple tasks like changing passwords or power cycling a computer for the first time in its life, it really helped me understand the value of creating things with non-technical users in mind.

                                    At both restaurants where I waited tables during high school and college, I learned a lot about people skills and customer service. As a bonus, both of these restaurants used Toast POS systems. Long story short, Toast was constantly having issues, especially back in 2019, which really showed me the cost of building inefficient systems—both for users and businesses.
